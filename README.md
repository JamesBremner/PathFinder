# PathFinder

Find paths through graphs with vertices and edges using C++ implementations of some standard graph theory algorithms.

The very first theorem of graph theory was presented in 1735 by Leonhard Euler. [Details](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Euler)

## Applications

### PathFinder

A GUI that reads text files specifying a graph and the path to be found

 * __Euler__ Path that traverses every edge exactly once [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Euler)
 * __Costs__  Cheapest or shortest paths between two vertices. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Costs)
 * __Tour__ Path that visits all vertices. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Tour)
 * __Cycle__ Find cycles in a graph.  [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Cycles)
 * __Spans__ Find minimum cost edges that cover every vertex. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Spans)
 * __Sales__ Path that visits every location specified on a 2D plane. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Sales)
 * __Cliques__ Find maximal cliques in graph. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Cliques)
 * __Flows__ Maximum flow through network between two vertices.  [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Flows)
 * __All Paths__  Find all the paths between two nodes in a directed graph. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/All-Paths)
 * __Probabilities__ Find the probability that an end node can be reached when links are available with specified probability [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/Probabilities)
 * __Allocate__  Find an allocation of agents to tasks that optimizes the number of tasks completed. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/Allocate)
 * __Node Cover__ Find nodes that cover every link in graph. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/Node-Cover) 
 
### Obstacles

A GUI that reads obstacle locations ( e.g. furniture in a room or crops in a field ) and calculates a route around them. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Obstacles)

### Maze

Generate random, solveable mazes and solve them. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/maze)
 
### Test

Run unit tests

### Graphex

Run timing tests

## Test Data

Test data files specifying graphs of various sizes up to hundreds of thousands of edges. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinder/wiki/Test-Data)
