# PathFinder

Find paths through undirected graphs.

## Applications

### PathFinder

A GUI that reads text files specifying a graph and the path to be found

 * __Costs__  Cheapest or shortest paths between two vertices. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Costs)
 * __Tour__ Path that visits all vertices. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Tour)
 * __Cycle__ Find cycles in directed graph.  [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Cycles)
 * __Spans__ Find minimum cost edges that cover every vertex. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Spans)
 * __Sales__ Path that visits every location specified on a 2D plane. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Sales)
 * __Cliques__ Find maximal cliques in graph. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Cliques)
 * __Flows__ Maximum flow through network between two vertices.  [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Flows)
 
### Obstacles

A GUI that reads obstacle locations ( e.g. furniture in a room or crops in a field ) and calculates a route around them. [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/JamesBremner/PathFinderFeb2023/wiki/Obstacles)
